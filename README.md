## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Originally this project was only playable via the console but I added HTML and CSS to provide a UI for the user and modified the JavaScript to be able to manipulate the DOM. The game is against a computer that randomly chooses its next move and whoever reaches a score of 5 wins the game.

## Optimizations:

I would love to go back and instead of adding event listeners to each choice button I would instead use event delegation and attach a single event listener to the container. I would also implement OOP in this app.

## Lessons Learned:

This project was really helpful in terms of learning how to work with the dom and how to manipulate it. I was able to manipulate the dom and either change or hide certain things depending on what was done. I also learned about the built-in Math object and some of its methods.
